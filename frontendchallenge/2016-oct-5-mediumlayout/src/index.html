        It's just not confusing but difficult?  Probably not the right choice of words but I'm conflicted.  There's one that seems okay but it doesn't have nearly as many downloads and/or stars as the other ones.  However, the more popular ones don't seem nearly as appealing as the former.  One could try them both out but it seems like kind of an inconvenience...given all the restarting of stuff and what not...

        Why does it take forever to do this? <br /><br />
        The internet makes it seem like you should be able to fire one of these off in no time at all and make it uber pretty to top it off as well.  Sigh, I lament over this a lot. Tis quite concerning.

        Oh boy, these service workers and what not.  They seem quite interesting with their lack of access to the dom.  Well, not really, with respect to their lack of access to the DOM. If I recall correctly, it just has to do with it being done programmatically.

        Random Text filler for spacing and stuff.  Such random text.  So many solutions for so many problems and/or itches that must be scratched.  Hopefully, this fillter text does its job and fills up the page as needed.  Yes, I know that the lorem ipsum text is here but I hvae yet to figure out where the option is.

        It would be ever so lovely if there were a one stop shop for tips regarding how to write one of those responsive web applications.  There probably are, however, I have yet to divine the magical 'Google' words that ever so elegantly delivers the link to me.

        In case, thou hath not noticed, I am writing just whatever comes ot my mind with minimal restraint.  It's interesting how medium uses SVG to draw all of its icons as opposed to saving a png/img and then loading it from somewhere or caching it on the user's machine. On the one hand, it's easier for me to cut and paste.  Well, no, not really.  I'm not terribly familiar with SVG.  Although numbers and whatnot leading to such an elegantly drawn picture.  Painstakingly crafted and/or nit-picked by numerous engineers and/or designers.  And here I am, stealing/borrowing the fruits of their labour.  It disturbs me that not all of the previously written sentences are formally complete sentences and that there are errors abound. Sadly, I'll just have to live with it.

        I believe with all of this extra text that I have written, I have finally achieved my goal.  I have uncovered spacing issues that I was not at the time acutely aware of. The banner at the bottom is fixed.  However, the text at the bottom of the page is obscured by the banner at the bottom.  There's probably a trick of some sort with this witchcrafty language that is CSS.

        Yet another issue uncovered.  The background-color does not carry forth beyond the 100% I have denoted earlier.
        I have just discovered the solution, at least for the time being.  A mere change from 100% for height with respect ot hte article_container to 'auto' addresses my woes.
