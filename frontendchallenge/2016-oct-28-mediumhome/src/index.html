            <h3>Docker, into the quicksand.</h3>
            <p>Therein, as they say, lies the rub.  Whatever that means.  It does sound pretty spiffy though.  Sometimes, docker does some pretty spiffy things.  I read a lot of this docker documentation and I am concerned I may be drinking a little bit too much of the Docker kool-aid.  Fortunately, I have a lot of digital whales to keep me company.  They so happen to be blue and metaphorically they're suposed to represent shipping containers.  I think.  Well, shipping containers have something to do with Docker.  In the containers go code for your application.</p>

            <h3>React, yet another framework to learn.</h3>
            <p>Oh my.  React has taken off.  It's amazing what one year over angular2/ new front end framework from google can do.  So, so many organizations have adopted it.  I like to think of FED (front end development) as drawing with only horizontal lines before and after React as suddenly being able to draw with vertical lines.  That's probably not the best analogy but it's the one I've been kicking around in my head for a while.  Sadly, I doth not know React as well as I should.  One day, I'll muster the nerve to replace one of these componenets with one that has been compiled with babel or browersify or webpack or the next hot bundling/task running tool that comes about.</p>

            <h3>It's complicated.</h3>
            <p>There's too much stuff in the world.  It's all so complicated.  Understanding the reason why the things are the way they are. There's so much history behind, well, everything.  The sequence of events that determine why something is the way it is.  The intent behind the action that made something the way it is. The reasoning behind that intent.  On and on it goes.  A weaving interconnected web of cause and effect and intent.  It's complicated. I guess it'll be all the more fulfilling once a grand meaning behind it all is divined.  Assuming there is one.  Let's naively assume there is.  It's more fun that way. My apologies for the fragments. Yes, they bother me too.</p>
