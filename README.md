### About

Just a front end for my github profile.  Turns out I didn't have any projects that were exclusively front end.  It's nice that Github throws the front end up without the thread that serves the file having to be woken up like heroku.

### Install

###### 1

Navigate to the index.html file via your web browser.  Occasionally some libraries don't work if you open them this way.

###### 2

You can use a server and have that serve the file to you.
